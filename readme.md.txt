So you find out you or your partner are expecting and the joys of parenthood starts to become a daunting reality.  With your new-found role comes the parties and duties of preparing for the new bundle of joy. Gone are the days of just a baby-shower now the trend is a gender-reveal prior to that.  So instead of one party your friends and family are obligated to attend and some assist in paying for two events.  This project is to help eliminate the stress and financial burden of an extra party, while keeping your family and friends in the loop.   This website is a way for the couple to share their story, registry, gender of the baby, and receive congratulatory messages.
